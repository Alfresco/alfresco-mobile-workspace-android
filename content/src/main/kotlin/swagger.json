For example:\n```JSON\n\"paging\": {\n  \"maxItems\": \"50\",\n  \"skipCount\": \"28\"\n}\n```\nThis example would ensure that results are **limited by Final Size**,\nskipping the first 28 results and returning the next 50.\n\nAlternatively, you can limit the results by using the **limits JSON body parameter**. For example,\n```JSON\n\"limits\": {\n  \"permissionEvaluationTime\": 20000,\n  \"permissionEvaluationCount\": 2000\n}\n```\n\nYou can use the **include JSON body parameter** to return additional information.\nThis works in the same way as in the /nodes/{nodeId}/children method in the core API. For example:\n```JSON\n\"include\": [\"aspectNames\", \"properties\", \"isLink\"]\n```\n\nYou can use the **fields JSON body parameter** to restrict the fields returned within a response if, for example, you want to save on overall bandwidth.\nThis works in the same way as in the /nodes/{nodeId}/children method in the core API. For example:\n```JSON\n\"fields\": [\"id\", \"name\", \"search\"]\n```\n\nYou can sort the results using the **sort JSON body parameter**, for example:\n```JSON\n\"sort\": [{\"type\":\"FIELD\", \"field\":\"cm:description\", \"ascending\":\"true\"}]\n```\n**Note:** the **sort** parameter is not supported for CMIS queries.\n\nBy default, search uses the **\"nodes\" location**, which is the **content store known as workspace://SpacesStore**.\nTo change the scope to another location you can use the **locations JSON body parameter**. You can specify either **nodes** (the default), **versions** or **deleted-nodes**.  For example,\n```JSON\n\"scope\": {\n    \"locations\": [\"deleted-nodes\"]\n}\n```\nYou can specify templates using the **templates JSON body parameter**, for example:\n```JSON\n\"templates\": [{\"name\": \"_PERSON\",\"template\": \"|%firstName OR |%lastName OR |%userName\"},\n              {\"name\": \"mytemplate\",\"template\": \"%cm:content\"}]\n```\n\n**Note: Spell checking only works on Search Services (Solr 6) if you have already enabled suggestions.**\n\nFor **spell checking** you can use a query like this:\n```JSON\n{\n  \"query\": {\n    \"query\": \"cm:title:alfrezco\"\n  },\n  \"spellcheck\": {\"query\": \"alfrezco\"}\n}\n```\n\nIf you are already specifying \"userQuery\" then the following may be easier\nand produces the same result :\n```JSON\n{\n  \"query\": {\n    \"query\": \"cm:title:alfrezco\",\n    \"userQuery\": \"alfrezco\"\n  },\n  \"spellcheck\": {}\n}\n```\n\nThe spellcheck response includes a spellCheck context like this:\n```JSON\n\"context\": {\n  \"spellCheck\": {\n    \"type\": \"searchInsteadFor\",\n    \"suggestions\": [\"alfresco\"]\n  }\n},\n```\n\nTo specify defaults, you  use a **defaults JSON body parameter**, for example:\n```JSON\n\"defaults\": {\n  \"textAttributes\": [\n    \"cm:content\", \"cm:name\"\n  ],\n  \"defaultFTSOperator\": \"AND\",\n  \"defaultFTSFieldOperator\": \"OR\",\n  \"namespace\": \"cm\",\n  \"defaultFieldName\": \"PATH\"\n}\n```\n\nYou can specify several filter queries using the **filterQueries JSON body parameter**, for example:\n```JSON\n\"filterQueries\": [{\"query\": \"TYPE:'cm:folder'\"},{\"query\": \"cm:creator:mjackson\"}]\n```\n\nYou can specify several facet queries using the **facetQueries JSON body parameter**, for example:\n```JSON\n\"facetQueries\": [{\"query\": \"created:2016\",\"label\": \"CreatedThisYear\"}]\n```\nThe response will contain a matching \"context\" section, the \"label\" will match the facet query.\n```JSON\n\"context\": {\n  \"facetQueries\": [\n    {\"label\": \"CreatedThisYear\",\"count\": 3}\n  ]\n},\n```\n\nA complete query for facetting via the content.size field looks this:\n```JSON\n{\n  \"query\": {\n    \"query\": \"presentation\",\n    \"language\": \"afts\"\n  },\n    \"facetQueries\": [\n        {\"query\": \"content.size:[0 TO 10240]\", \"label\": \"xtra small\"},\n        {\"query\": \"content.size:[10240 TO 102400]\", \"label\": \"small\"},\n        {\"query\": \"content.size:[102400 TO 1048576]\", \"label\": \"medium\"},\n        {\"query\": \"content.size:[1048576 TO 16777216]\", \"label\": \"large\"},\n        {\"query\": \"content.size:[16777216 TO 134217728]\", \"label\": \"xtra large\"},\n        {\"query\": \"content.size:[134217728 TO MAX]\", \"label\": \"XX large\"}\n  ],\n    \"facetFields\": {\"facets\": [{\"field\": \"'content.size'\"}]}\n}\n```\n\nThe response will contain a matching \"context\" section, the \"label\" will match the facet query.\n```JSON\n\"context\": {\n  \"facetQueries\": [\n    { \"label\": \"small\",\"count\": 2 },\n    { \"label\": \"large\",\"count\": 0 },\n    { \"label\": \"xtra small\",\"count\": 5 },\n    { \"label\": \"xtra large\",\"count\": 56},\n    { \"label\": \"medium\",\"count\": 4 },\n    { \"label\": \"XX large\", \"count\": 1 }\n  ]\n},\n```\n\nYou can specify several facet fields using the **facetFields JSON body parameter**, for example:\n```JSON\n\"facetFields\": {\"facets\": [{\"field\": \"creator\", \"mincount\": 1}, {\"field\": \"modifier\", \"mincount\": 1}]}\n```\nThe response will contain a matching \"context\" section, the \"label\" will match the facet field.\n```JSON\n\"context\": {\n   \"facetsFields\": [\n     {  \"label\": \"creator\",\n        \"buckets\": [\n          { \"label\": \"System\", \"count\": 75 },\n          { \"label\": \"mjackson\", \"count\": 5 }\n        ]},\n     {  \"label\": \"modifier\",\n        \"buckets\": [\n          { \"label\": \"System\", \"count\": 72 },\n          { \"label\": \"mjackson\", \"count\": 5 },\n          { \"label\": \"admin\", \"count\": 3 }\n        ]}\n   ]\n},\n```\n\nGrouping facet queries that go together can be done by specifying the group label in the fact queries as follow:\n```JSON\n    {\n        \"query\": {\n            \"query\": \"presentation\"\n        },\n        \"facetQueries\": [\n            {\"query\": \"content.size:[0 TO 102400]\", \"label\": \"small\", \"group\":\"foo\"},\n            {\"query\": \"content.size:[102400 TO 1048576]\", \"label\": \"medium\",\"group\":\"foo\"},\n            {\"query\": \"content.size:[1048576 TO 16777216]\", \"label\": \"large\",\"group\":\"foo\"}\n        ]\n    }\n```\nThe above query returns the results a faceted field grouped under the label foo:\n```JSON\n{\n    \"context\": {\"facetsFields\": [{\n        \"label\": \"foo\",\n        \"buckets\": [\n            {\n                \"count\": 109,\n                \"label\": \"small\",\n                \"filterQuery\": \"content.size:[0 TO 102400]\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"count\": 0,\n                \"label\": \"large\",\n                \"filterQuery\": \"content.size:[1048576 TO 16777216]\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"count\": 0,\n                \"label\": \"medium\",\n                \"filterQuery\": \"content.size:[102400 TO 1048576]\"\n            }\n        ]\n    }]\n}\n```\nRange Faceting is supported by the **ranges JSON body parameter**, for example:\n```JSON\n    {\n        \"query\": {\n            \"query\": \"presentation\"\n        },\n        \"ranges\": [\n        {\n            \"field\": \"content.size\",\n             \"start\": \"0\",\n             \"end\": \"100\",\n             \"gap\": \"20\",\n             \"hardend\": true\n        },\n        {\n            \"field\": \"created\",\n            \"start\": \"2015-09-29T10:45:15.729Z\",\n            \"end\": \"2016-09-29T10:45:15.729Z\",\n            \"gap\": \"+100DAY\"\n        }]\n    }\n```\nAn example query for **search highlighting** could look like this:\n```JSON\n{\n  \"query\": {\n    \"query\": \"description:workflow\",\n    \"userQuery\":\"workflow\"\n  },\n  \"highlight\": {\n    \"prefix\": \"¿\",\n    \"postfix\": \"?\",\n    \"mergeContiguous\": true,\n    \"fields\": [\n      {\n        \"field\": \"cm:title\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"field\": \"description\",\n        \"prefix\": \"(\",\n        \"postfix\": \")\"\n      }\n\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\nThe example above changes the highlighting prefix and postfix from the\n default <em> for all fields to ¿? and just for the \"description\" field to ().\n The hightlight information is added in each node entry response; here is\n an example partial response:\n```\n\"entry\": {\n        \"createdAt\": \"2016-10-12T15:24:31.202+0000\",\n        \"isFolder\": true,\n        \"search\": {\n          \"score\": 1,\n          \"highlight\": [\n            {\n              \"field\": \"cm:title\",\n              \"snippets\": [\n                \"Customized ¿Workflow? Process Definitions\"\n              ]\n            },\n            {\n              \"field\": \"description\",\n              \"snippets\": [\n                \"Customized (Workflow) Process Definitions\"\n              ]\n            }\n          ]\n      },\n```\n","operationId":"search","produces":["application/json"],"parameters":[{"in":"body","name":"queryBody","description":"Generic query API\n","required":true,"schema":{"$ref":"#/definitions/SearchRequest"}}],"responses":{"200":{"description":"Successful response","schema":{"$ref":"#/definitions/ResultSetPaging"}},"default":{"description":"Unexpected error","schema":{"$ref":"#/definitions/Error"}}},"x-alfresco-since":"5.2"}},"/alfresco/versions/1/nodes/{nodeId}/comments":{"get":{"tags":["comments"],"summary":"List comments","description":"Gets a list of comments for the node **nodeId**, sorted chronologically with the newest comment first.","operationId":"listComments","produces":["application/json"],"parameters":[{"name":"nodeId","in":"path","description":"The identifier of a node.","required":true,"type":"string"},{"name":"skipCount","in":"query","description":"The number of entities that exist in the collection before those included in this list.\nIf not supplied then the default value is 0.\n","required":false,"type":"integer","default":0,"minimum":0},{"name":"maxItems","in":"query","description":"The maximum number of items to return in the list.\nIf not supplied then the default value is 100.\n","required":false,"type":"integer","default":100,"minimum":1},{"name":"fields","in":"query","description":"A list of field names.\n\nYou can use this parameter to restrict the fields\nreturned within a response if, for example, you want to save on overall bandwidth.\n\nThe list applies to a returned individual\nentity or entries within a collection.\n\nIf the API method also supports the **include**\nparameter, then the fields specified in the **include**\nparameter are returned in addition to those specified in the **fields** parameter.\n","required":false,"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"},"collectionFormat":"csv"}],"responses":{"200":{"description":"Successful response","schema":{"$ref":"#/definitions/CommentPaging"}},"400":{"description":"Invalid parameter: **nodeId** exists but does not identify a file or a folder,\nor the value of **maxItems** is invalid, or the value of **skipCount** is invalid\n"},"401":{"description":"Authentication failed"},"403":{"description":"User does not have permission read comments on the node"},"404":{"description":"**nodeId** does not exist\n"},"default":{"description":"Unexpected error","schema":{"$ref":"#/definitions/Error"}}}},"post":{"tags":["comments"],"summary":"Create a comment","description":"Creates a comment on node **nodeId**.

For example, to create a folder:\n```JSON\n{\n  \"name\":\"My Folder\",\n  \"nodeType\":\"cm:folder\"\n}\n```\n\nYou can create an empty file like this:\n```JSON\n{\n  \"name\":\"My text file.txt\",\n  \"nodeType\":\"cm:content\"\n}\n```\nYou can update binary content using the ```PUT /nodes/{nodeId}``` API method.\n\nYou can create a folder, or other node, inside a folder hierarchy:\n```JSON\n{\n  \"name\":\"My Special Folder\",\n  \"nodeType\":\"cm:folder\",\n  \"relativePath\":\"X/Y/Z\"\n}\n```\nThe **relativePath** specifies the folder structure to create relative to the node **nodeId**. Folders in the\n**relativePath** that do not exist are created before the node is created.\n\nYou can set properties when you create a new node:\n```JSON\n{\n  \"name\":\"My Other Folder\",\n  \"nodeType\":\"cm:folder\",\n  \"properties\":\n  {\n    \"cm:title\":\"Folder title\",\n    \"cm:description\":\"This is an important folder\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nYou can set multi-value properties when you create a new node which supports properties of type multiple.\n ```JSON\n{\n  \"name\":\"My Other Folder\",\n  \"nodeType\":\"custom:destination\",\n  \"properties\":\n  {\n    \"cm:title\":\"Folder title\",\n    \"cm:description\":\"This is an important folder\",\n    \"custom:locations\": [\n                         \"location X\",\n                         \"location Y\"\n                        ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAny missing aspects are applied automatically. For example, **cm:titled** in the JSON shown above. You can set aspects\nexplicitly, if needed, using an **aspectNames** field.\n\n**Note:** setting properties of type d:content and d:category are not supported.\n\nYou can also optionally disable (or enable) inherited permissions via *isInheritanceEnabled* flag:\n```JSON\n{\n  \"permissions\":\n    {\n      \"isInheritanceEnabled\": false,\n      \"locallySet\":\n        [\n          {\"authorityId\": \"GROUP_special\", \"name\": \"Read\", \"accessStatus\":\"DENIED\"},\n          {\"authorityId\": \"testuser\", \"name\": \"Contributor\", \"accessStatus\":\"ALLOWED\"}\n        ]\n    }\n}\n```\n\nTypically, for files and folders, the primary children are created within the parent folder using the default \"cm:contains\" assocType.\nIf the content model allows then it is also possible to create primary children with a different assoc type. For example:\n```JSON\n{\n  \"name\":\"My Node\",\n  \"nodeType\":\"my:specialNodeType\",\n  \"association\":\n  {\n    \"assocType\":\"my:specialAssocType\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAdditional associations can be added after creating a node. You can also add associations at the time the node is created. This is\nrequired, for example, if the content model specifies that a node has mandatory associations to one or more existing nodes. You can optionally\nspecify an array of **secondaryChildren** to create one or more secondary child associations, such that the newly created node acts as a parent node.\nYou can optionally specify an array of **targets** to create one or more peer associations such that the newly created node acts as a source node.\nFor example, to associate one or more secondary children at time of creation:\n```JSON\n{\n  \"name\":\"My Folder\",\n  \"nodeType\":\"cm:folder\",\n  \"secondaryChildren\":\n    [ {\"childId\":\"abcde-01234-...\", \"assocType\":\"my:specialChildAssocType\"} ]\n}\n```\nFor example, to associate one or more targets at time of creation:\n```JSON\n{\n  \"name\":\"My Folder\",\n  \"nodeType\":\"cm:folder\",\n  \"targets\":\n    [ {\"targetId\":\"abcde-01234-...\", \"assocType\":\"my:specialPeerAssocType\"} ]\n}\n```\n\n**Note:** You can create more than one child by\nspecifying a list of nodes in the JSON body. For example, the following JSON\nbody creates two folders inside the specified **nodeId**, if the **nodeId** identifies\na folder:\n\n```JSON\n[\n  {\n    \"name\":\"My Folder 1\",\n    \"nodeType\":\"cm:folder\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\":\"My Folder 2\",\n    \"nodeType\":\"cm:folder\"\n  }\n]\n```\nIf you specify a list as input, then a paginated list rather than an entry is returned in the response body. For example:\n\n```JSON\n{\n  \"list\": {\n    \"pagination\": {\n      \"count\": 2,\n      \"hasMoreItems\": false,\n      \"totalItems\": 2,\n      \"skipCount\": 0,\n      \"maxItems\": 100\n    },\n    \"entries\": [\n      {\n        \"entry\": {\n          ...\n        }\n      },\n      {\n        \"entry\": {\n          ...\n        }\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n**Note:** When creating a new node using JSON by default versioning is disabled.\nSince Alfresco 6.2.3 **versioningEnabled** flag was introduced offering better control over the new node Versioning.\n\n| **versioningEnabled** | **majorVersion** | **Version Type** |\n|-----------------------|------------------|------------------|\n|        unset          |        unset     |    Unversioned   |\n|        unset          |        true      |    MAJOR         |\n|        unset          |        false     |    MINOR         |\n|        true           |        unset     |    MAJOR         |\n|        true           |        true      |    MAJOR         |\n|        true           |        false     |    MINOR         |\n|        false          |        true      |    Unversioned   |\n|        false          |        false     |    Unversioned   |\n|        false          |        true      |    Unversioned   |\n<br>\n","operationId":"createNode","consumes":["application/json","multipart/form-data"],"produces":["application/json"],"parameters":[{"name":"nodeId","in":"path","description":"The identifier of a node.
