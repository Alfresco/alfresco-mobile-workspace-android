    /**
     * Create a node
     * **Note:** this endpoint is available in Alfresco 5.2 and newer versions.  Create a node and add it as a primary child of node **nodeId**.  This endpoint supports both JSON and multipart/form-data (file upload).  **Using multipart/form-data**  Use the **filedata** field to represent the content to upload, for example, the following curl command will create a node with the contents of test.txt in the test user's home folder.  ```curl -utest:test -X POST host:port/alfresco/api/-default-/public/alfresco/versions/1/nodes/-my-/children -F filedata=@test.txt```  You can use the **name** field to give an alternative name for the new file.  You can use the **nodeType** field to create a specific type. The default is cm:content.  You can use the **renditions** field to create renditions (e.g. doclib) asynchronously upon upload. Also, as requesting rendition is a background process, any rendition failure (e.g. No transformer is currently available) will not fail the whole upload and has the potential to silently fail.  Use **overwrite** to overwrite an existing file, matched by name. If the file is versionable, the existing content is replaced.  When you overwrite existing content, you can set the **majorVersion** boolean field to **true** to indicate a major version should be created. The default for **majorVersion** is **false**. Setting  **majorVersion** enables versioning of the node, if it is not already versioned.  When you overwrite existing content, you can use the **comment** field to add a version comment that appears in the version history. This also enables versioning of this node, if it is not already versioned.  You can set the **autoRename** boolean field to automatically resolve name clashes. If there is a name clash, then the API method tries to create a unique name using an integer suffix.  You can use the **relativePath** field to specify the folder structure to create relative to the node **nodeId**. Folders in the **relativePath** that do not exist are created before the node is created.  Any other field provided will be treated as a property to set on the newly created node.  **Note:** setting properties of type d:content and d:category are not supported.  **Note:** When creating a new node using multipart/form-data by default versioning is enabled and set to MAJOR Version. Since Alfresco 6.2.3 **versioningEnabled** flag was introduced offering better control over the new node Versioning.  | **versioningEnabled** | **majorVersion** | **Version Type** | |-----------------------|------------------|------------------| |        unset          |        unset     |    MAJOR         | |        unset          |        true      |    MAJOR         | |        unset          |        false     |    MINOR         | |        true           |        unset     |    MAJOR         | |        true           |        true      |    MAJOR         | |        true           |        false     |    MINOR         | |        false          |        true      |    Unversioned   | |        false          |        false     |    Unversioned   | |        false          |        true      |    Unversioned   | <br>  **Using JSON**  You must specify at least a **name** and **nodeType**. For example, to create a folder: ```JSON {   \"name\":\"My Folder\",   \"nodeType\":\"cm:folder\" } ```  You can create an empty file like this: ```JSON {   \"name\":\"My text file.txt\",   \"nodeType\":\"cm:content\" } ``` You can update binary content using the ```PUT /nodes/{nodeId}``` API method.  You can create a folder, or other node, inside a folder hierarchy: ```JSON {   \"name\":\"My Special Folder\",   \"nodeType\":\"cm:folder\",   \"relativePath\":\"X/Y/Z\" } ``` The **relativePath** specifies the folder structure to create relative to the node **nodeId**. Folders in the **relativePath** that do not exist are created before the node is created.  You can set properties when you create a new node: ```JSON {   \"name\":\"My Other Folder\",   \"nodeType\":\"cm:folder\",   \"properties\":   {     \"cm:title\":\"Folder title\",     \"cm:description\":\"This is an important folder\"   } } ```  You can set multi-value properties when you create a new node which supports properties of type multiple.  ```JSON {   \"name\":\"My Other Folder\",   \"nodeType\":\"custom:destination\",   \"properties\":   {     \"cm:title\":\"Folder title\",     \"cm:description\":\"This is an important folder\",     \"custom:locations\": [                          \"location X\",                          \"location Y\"                         ]   } } ```  Any missing aspects are applied automatically. For example, **cm:titled** in the JSON shown above. You can set aspects explicitly, if needed, using an **aspectNames** field.  **Note:** setting properties of type d:content and d:category are not supported.  You can also optionally disable (or enable) inherited permissions via *isInheritanceEnabled* flag: ```JSON {   \"permissions\":     {       \"isInheritanceEnabled\": false,       \"locallySet\":         [           {\"authorityId\": \"GROUP_special\", \"name\": \"Read\", \"accessStatus\":\"DENIED\"},           {\"authorityId\": \"testuser\", \"name\": \"Contributor\", \"accessStatus\":\"ALLOWED\"}         ]     } } ```  Typically, for files and folders, the primary children are created within the parent folder using the default \"cm:contains\" assocType. If the content model allows then it is also possible to create primary children with a different assoc type. For example: ```JSON {   \"name\":\"My Node\",   \"nodeType\":\"my:specialNodeType\",   \"association\":   {     \"assocType\":\"my:specialAssocType\"   } } ```  Additional associations can be added after creating a node. You can also add associations at the time the node is created. This is required, for example, if the content model specifies that a node has mandatory associations to one or more existing nodes. You can optionally specify an array of **secondaryChildren** to create one or more secondary child associations, such that the newly created node acts as a parent node. You can optionally specify an array of **targets** to create one or more peer associations such that the newly created node acts as a source node. For example, to associate one or more secondary children at time of creation: ```JSON {   \"name\":\"My Folder\",   \"nodeType\":\"cm:folder\",   \"secondaryChildren\":     [ {\"childId\":\"abcde-01234-...\", \"assocType\":\"my:specialChildAssocType\"} ] } ``` For example, to associate one or more targets at time of creation: ```JSON {   \"name\":\"My Folder\",   \"nodeType\":\"cm:folder\",   \"targets\":     [ {\"targetId\":\"abcde-01234-...\", \"assocType\":\"my:specialPeerAssocType\"} ] } ```  **Note:** You can create more than one child by specifying a list of nodes in the JSON body. For example, the following JSON body creates two folders inside the specified **nodeId**, if the **nodeId** identifies a folder:  ```JSON [   {     \"name\":\"My Folder 1\",     \"nodeType\":\"cm:folder\"   },   {     \"name\":\"My Folder 2\",     \"nodeType\":\"cm:folder\"   } ] ``` If you specify a list as input, then a paginated list rather than an entry is returned in the response body. For example:  ```JSON {   \"list\": {     \"pagination\": {       \"count\": 2,       \"hasMoreItems\": false,       \"totalItems\": 2,       \"skipCount\": 0,       \"maxItems\": 100     },     \"entries\": [       {         \"entry\": {           ...         }       },       {         \"entry\": {           ...         }       }     ]   } } ``` **Note:** When creating a new node using JSON by default versioning is disabled. Since Alfresco 6.2.3 **versioningEnabled** flag was introduced offering better control over the new node Versioning.  | **versioningEnabled** | **majorVersion** | **Version Type** | |-----------------------|------------------|------------------| |        unset          |        unset     |    Unversioned   | |        unset          |        true      |    MAJOR         | |        unset          |        false     |    MINOR         | |        true           |        unset     |    MAJOR         | |        true           |        true      |    MAJOR         | |        true           |        false     |    MINOR         | |        false          |        true      |    Unversioned   | |        false          |        false     |    Unversioned   | |        false          |        true      |    Unversioned   | <br>

The default order is always ascending, but you can use an optional **ASC** or **DESC** modifier to specify an ascending or descending sort order.  For example, specifying ```orderBy=name DESC``` returns a mixed folder/file list in descending **name** order.  You can use any of the following fields to order the results: * isFolder * name * mimeType * nodeType * sizeInBytes * modifiedAt * createdAt * modifiedByUser * createdByUser
     * The endpoint is owned by defaultname service owner
     * @param nodeId The identifier of a node. You can also use one of these well-known aliases: * -my- * -shared- * -root-  (required)
     * @param skipCount The number of entities that exist in the collection before those included in this list. If not supplied then the default value is 0.  (optional, default to 0)
     * @param maxItems The maximum number of items to return in the list. If not supplied then the default value is 100.  (optional, default to 100)
     * @param orderBy A string to control the order of the entities returned in a list. You can use the **orderBy** parameter to sort the list by one or more fields.  Each field has a default sort order, which is normally ascending order. Read the API method implementation notes above to check if any fields used in this method have a descending default search order.  To sort the entities in a specific order, you can use the **ASC** and **DESC** keywords for any field.  (optional)
     * @param where Optionally filter the list. Here are some examples:  *   &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;where&#x3D;(isFolder&#x3D;true)&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;  *   &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;where&#x3D;(isFile&#x3D;true)&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;  *   &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;where&#x3D;(nodeType&#x3D;&#39;my:specialNodeType&#39;)&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;  *   &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;where&#x3D;(nodeType&#x3D;&#39;my:specialNodeType INCLUDESUBTYPES&#39;)&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;  *   &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;where&#x3D;(isPrimary&#x3D;true)&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;  *   &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;where&#x3D;(assocType&#x3D;&#39;my:specialAssocType&#39;)&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;  *   &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;where&#x3D;(isPrimary&#x3D;false and assocType&#x3D;&#39;my:specialAssocType&#39;)&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;  (optional)
     * @param include Returns additional information about the node. The following optional fields can be requested: * allowableOperations * aspectNames * association * isLink * isFavorite * isLocked * path * properties * permissions  (optional)
     * @param relativePath Return information on children in the folder resolved by this path. The path is relative to **nodeId**. (optional)
     * @param includeSource Also include **source** in addition to **entries** with folder information on the parent node – either the specified parent **nodeId**, or as resolved by **relativePath**. (optional)
     * @param fields A list of field names.  You can use this parameter to restrict the fields returned within a response if, for example, you want to save on overall bandwidth.  The list applies to a returned individual entity or entries within a collection.  If the API method also supports the **include** parameter, then the fields specified in the **include** parameter are returned in addition to those specified in the **fields** parameter.  (optional)

     * Lock a node
     * **Note:** this endpoint is available in Alfresco 5.2 and newer versions.  Places a lock on node **nodeId**.  **Note:** you can only lock files. More specifically, a node can only be locked if it is of type `cm:content` or a subtype of `cm:content`.  The lock is owned by the current user, and prevents other users or processes from making updates to the node until the lock is released.  If the **timeToExpire** is not set or is zero, then the lock never expires.  Otherwise, the **timeToExpire** is the number of seconds before the lock expires.  When a lock expires, the lock is released.  If the node is already locked, and the user is the lock owner, then the lock is renewed with the new **timeToExpire**.  By default, a lock is applied that allows the owner to update or delete the node. You can use **type** to change the lock type to one of the following: * **ALLOW_OWNER_CHANGES** (default) changes to the node can be made only by the lock owner. This enum is the same value as the deprecated WRITE_LOCK described in `org.alfresco.service.cmr.lock.LockType` in the Alfresco Public Java API. This is the default value. * **FULL** no changes by any user are allowed. This enum is the same value as the deprecated READ_ONLY_LOCK described in `org.alfresco.service.cmr.lock.LockType` in the Alfresco Public Java API.  By default, a lock is persisted in the database. You can create a volatile in-memory lock by setting the **lifetime** property to EPHEMERAL. You might choose use EPHEMERAL locks, for example, if you are taking frequent short-term locks that you don't need to be kept over a restart of the repository. In this case you don't need the overhead of writing the locks to the database.  If a lock on the node cannot be taken, then an error is returned.
